\section{Naming conventions and references}\label{sec:namingConventions}
Give everything meaningful names and create labels \verb|\label{<name>}| for sections, figures, and tables as soon as you create them.

Use \texttt{sec:<meaningfulname>} , \texttt{fig:<meaningfulname>} , \texttt{tab:<meaningfulname>}, \texttt{eq:<meaningfulname>} when creating labels for sections, figures, tables and equations respectively.

A meaningful name is a name that tells the reader (i.e. future you or a collaborator) what the label refers to. For sections the section title is a good start. Avoid using numbers and cryptic letter combinations.

\begin{whyblock} You want others and future you to be able to understand what the label means.\end{whyblock}
